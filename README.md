### Hi, I'm Vladislav


As a result-oriented software engineer, I can help you run an MVP or develop complex digital products such as  **web applications, APIs, e-commerce systems, and CRMs.**


I have a strong background in backend development and experience using Vue.js for frontend. In addition to writing code,  **I am skilled at translating business requirements into functional products.** 

I am well-suited for fast-moving teams that need a full-stack developer with strong soft skills and experience in DevOps.

You can shoot me an email at vlad+github@alexeyev.me
